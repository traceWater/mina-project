              Two creative minds that came together at art school, Alex and
              Laura founded Mina with a shared passion for design and
              sustainability. For them, success is more than just about having a
              bestselling product.
              <br />
              Every piece in our store has been created with love by Alex and
              Laura. They take inspiration from the world around them when it
              comes to shapes, colors, and the clay that they work with.
