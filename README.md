## Overview
This website was created as a method to collaborate with team mates using GitHub collaboration and merges.  
The exercise is intended to provide practicle experience working in development teams in the GitHub environment. 
### The challenge
- Identify a website to duplicate that was not too difficult and work with team mates to develop the repository and keep the project on task and in scope.
 Learn to use best practices within a team and identify and resolve conflicts as they arise. 
### Designs

## Our process
I reviewed the design and determined the layout contained a Hero, four rows, and a footer component.  Within each component there were various graphics, navigation, and fonts to be considered. 
### Built with
- [Custom CSS] (https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [JavaScript] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
### What We learned
we learned that creating the repository and setting the project up from the beginning is critical to having full functionality in GitHub.
- Select one person to be the merge master to keep Pull and Merge activity in Sync
- COMMUNICATE, COMMUNICATE, COMMUNICATE.  We did this well and had only a couple of minor conflicts to resolve.
- Select one person to be the merge master
- Only push to your dev branch and not main/master branches.
- Plan the project development standards such as .css naming conventions
- Segmenting the project and documenting individual tasks and responsibility keeps everyone in sync 
- Work only on your component parts of the project.
- If working on other members components, only do so after a push/merge/pull
- Only one person working in a component at a time between pulls.
